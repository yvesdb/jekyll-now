## Connecting a treadmill to the IBM Cloud IoT Platform

Continuing from the previous blogs, I will explain how to connect a treadmill as a sensor within the IBM Cloud IoT Platform.

First we need to create a "Internet of Things Platform Starter" kit within [https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?search=Internet%20of%20things&category=starterkits](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?search=Internet%20of%20things&category=starterkits)
In order to do this you will need an IBM Cloud account. You can just signup for a free Lite account, no credit card required.
The starter kit contains the "Internet of Things" service as well as a "Cloudant" Database and a "Node-Red" runtime, which we will later use to create some dashboards.

Next, I created a device type "ESP32" and a device "ESPRESSIF" (you can pick whatever names you want here). When creating a device you can provide your own authentication token or you can let the system generate one for you. I prefer to set my own, which makes it easier to remember afterwords.

Basically, that's all we need to setup in the IoT platform.
Next we need to adapt the Arduino code to make a connection the IBM IoT service using MQTT.
You can find the code [here](Treadmill-Bluetooth-IoT/Treadmill_BLE_IBM_MQTT/Treadmill_BLE_IBM_MQTT.ino)
